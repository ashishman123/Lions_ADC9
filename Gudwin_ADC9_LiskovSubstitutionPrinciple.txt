The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
An override method of a subclass needs to accept the same input parameter values as the method of the superclass.
When this principle is violated, it tends to result in a lot of extra conditional logic scattered throughout the application.
