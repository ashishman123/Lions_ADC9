In programming, the open/closed principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extensions, but closed for modification.
 class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.
